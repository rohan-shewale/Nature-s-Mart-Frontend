    //             Groundnut is a significant oilseed, ideal for cultivation in
    //             tropic regions of the country. Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), is
    //             a species in the legume or "bean" family. It is considered to be
    //             local in South America. These are known by many other local
    //             names such as earthnuts, ground nuts, goober peas, monkey nuts,
    //             pygmy nuts and peanuts. Despite its name and appearance, the
    //             peanut is not a nut, but rather a legume.
    //             <p></p>
    //             Groundnut is the third most important oilseed of world. In
    //             India, it is available throughout the year. It is important

    //               increases the soil temperature by retaining the heat from the

    //               groundnut cultivation. Environment of Broad beds and furrows
    //               system is favourable for the development of groundnut pods, by
    //               doing little modification in the size, beds are formed along
    //               with polyethylene film mulched. Make beds of 60 cm width and
    //               leave 15 cm on the either side for the furrows. In a plot size
    //               of 4.5 m x 6.0 m, five beds can be made. After the formation
    //               of the bed and fertilizer application, spread black polythene
    //               sheet (90 cm width) over the soil surface. Polyethylene sheet
    //               of Seven micron @20kg/acre is required. Holes can be made at
    //               required spacing of 30 x10 cm before spreading of the sheets.
    //               The seed requirement is similar to normal groundnut

            General Information
          </h2>
          <p className="para">
            Groundnut is a significant oilseed, ideal for cultivation in
            tropic regions of the country. Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), is
            a species in the legume or "bean" family. It is considered to be
            local in South America. These are known by many other local
            names such as earthnuts, ground nuts, goober peas, monkey nuts,
            pygmy nuts and peanuts. Despite its name and appearance, the
            peanut is not a nut, but rather a legume.
            <p></p>
            Groundnut is the third most important oilseed of world. In
            India, it is available throughout the year. It is important
            source of protein grown mostly under rain-fed conditions. In
            India, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat,
            Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are major
            groundnut growing states.

            SOIL
          </h2>
          <p className="para">
            Groundnut is raised in a sandy loam as well as well drained
            sandy clay loam soil. Deep well- drained soil with pH of 6.5 -7
            as well as having great fertility are perfect for groundnut
            cultivation. Spanish as well as Runner varieties are beneficial
            for good quality soil compared to the Virginia forms. The lack
            of pods is often rich in heavier grounds. An excellent climatic
            condition for better germination of groundnut is 31Â° C. Heavy
            and stiff clays are unsuitable for groundnut cultivation as the
            pod development is hampered in these soils.

          <p className="para">
            After harvesting of previous crop, plough the land twice and
            pulverised soil to obtained good tilth of soil. Give a third
            ploughing if necessary for rainfed crop, in the end of June or
            early July. Use harrow or tillers for cultivation purpose. When
            land is heavily infested with perennial weeds, very deep
            ploughing is needed. For irrigated crop, make beds of convenient
            size depending upon topography. Nature of irrigation source etc.
            Application of 5-7 ton/acre of chicken manure or 10 ton/acre of
            farm yard manure or well decomposed cow dung should be done 1
            month before sowing. It helps to improve soil structure along
            with good plant growth.

          <p className="lead para p-background">
            <b><strong>Time of sowing</strong></b>
            <br />
            Sow the rainfed crop with the advent of monsoon in the last
            week of June or in the Ist week of July. Complete sowing as
            early as possible as delay sowing results in reduction in
            yield. Where irrigation facility is available sow kharif
            groundnut from April end to May end. &nbsp; <br />
            <br />
            <b><strong>Spacing</strong></b>
            <br />
            Spacing to be adopted is depends upon type of variety. i.e.,
            for semi spreading variety (M 522) use spacing of 30cm between
            the rows and 22.5 cm between plants and for bunchy type
            varieties (SG 99, SG84) use spacing of 30x15 cm.

            </b>
            <br />
            Healthy and well developed pods should be hand shelled with a
            suitable groundnut sheer about fornight before sowing. Pods
            are sown with help of seed drill at depth of 8-10 cm at a seed
            rate of 38-40 kg/acre.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b><strong>Method of Sowing </strong></b>
            <br />
            seeds are sown with help of seed drill.
            <br />
            <strong>ICRISAT method:</strong> Polythene mulching has been
            attributed as one of the major improved cultivation practices
            for enhanced productivity of groundnut in China. When grown
            under polythene mulch system, groundnut matures about 10 days
            earlier than under non-mulched condition. Polythene mulching
            increases the soil temperature by retaining the heat from the
            sun. The increased accumulated temperature shortens the crop
            period. During the hot season it also protects the soil from
            direct sunlight.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this technology, Broad beds and furrows are used for
            groundnut cultivation. Environment of Broad beds and furrows
            system is favourable for the development of groundnut pods, by
            doing little modification in the size, beds are formed along
            with polyethylene film mulched. Make beds of 60 cm width and
            leave 15 cm on the either side for the furrows. In a plot size
            of 4.5 m x 6.0 m, five beds can be made. After the formation
            of the bed and fertilizer application, spread black polythene
            sheet (90 cm width) over the soil surface. Polyethylene sheet
            of Seven micron @20kg/acre is required. Holes can be made at
            required spacing of 30 x10 cm before spreading of the sheets.
            The seed requirement is similar to normal groundnut
            cultivation

            Weed control during first 45 days of growth period is essential
            for good yield. The most critical period is 3-6 weeks after
            sowing of crop. The average yield loss due to weed is about 30%
            whereas under poor management yield loss by weed may be 60%.
            Therefore carryout mechanical or chemical weed control during
            initial stage of crop growth.
            <br />
            Give two hoeing after the first three weeks of sowing and then
            after second three weeks of sowing. No interculture would be
            done after the pegs have commmenced going underground. Apply
            Fluchoralin @ 600 ml per acre or Pendimethalin @ 1 ltr per acre
            as pre-emergence area followed by hand weeding once 36-40 days
            after planting.
            <br />
            Accomplish earthing up during second hand weeding/late hand
            weeding (in herbicide application). It is an important operation
            in groundnut. Earthing up is to be done within 40-45 days after
            sowing as it helps for the penetration of pegs in the soil and
            also facilitates for increased pod development.
