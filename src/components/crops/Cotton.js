    //             Cotton is one of the most important fibre and cash crop of India
    //             as well as of entire world. It plays a dominant role in the
    //             industrial and agricultural economy of the country. It provides
    //             the basic raw material to cotton textile industry. In India it
    //             provides direct livelihood to 6 million farmers and about 40-50
    //             million people are employed in cotton trade and its processing.
    //             Cotton is a water thirsty crop and around 6% of the water for
    //             irrigation in is used for its cultivation. In India, it is grown

          <p className="para">
            Cotton is one of the most important fibre and cash crop of India
            as well as of entire world. It plays a dominant role in the
            industrial and agricultural economy of the country. It provides
            the basic raw material to cotton textile industry. In India it
            provides direct livelihood to 6 million farmers and about 40-50
            million people are employed in cotton trade and its processing.
            Cotton is a water thirsty crop and around 6% of the water for
            irrigation in is used for its cultivation. In India, it is grown
            on a large scale in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya
            Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Uttar
            Pradesh. Gujarat is the largest producer of cotton followed by
            Maharashtra and Punjab. It is vital kharif crop of Punjab. The
            average lint yield of the State is around 697 kg per hectare.

            Optimum time for sowing is in April - mid May. For Management
            of Mealybug, sow Bajra, Arhar, Maize and Jowar in the fields
            surrounding cotton crop. Avoid growing tur, moong and bhendi
            in and around cotton field as these harbour insect pests. In
            Punjab cotton wheat rotation is common but rotation with
            berseem and clusterbean has been found to have beneficial
            effect on the succeeding cotton crop. <br />
            <br />
            <b><strong>Spacing</strong></b>
            <br />
            For American cotton use spacing of 75x15 cm under irrigated
            condition while under rain fed condition use spacing of 60x30
            cm. For desi cotton use spacing of 60x30 cm for rain fed as
            well as for irrigated condition.

            <b><strong>Method of Sowing </strong></b>
            <br />
            For sowing use seed drill for desi cotton while dibbling of
            seed is done in case of hybrids and Bt cotton. Square planting
            is beneficial compared to rectangular planting. Few gaps arise
            due to failure of seed germination and mortality of seedling.
            To overcome this gap filling is necessary. Two weeks after
            sowing the weak/diseased/damaged seedlings should be removed
            by keeping a healthy seedling/hill.

            <br />
            Seed of cotton is covered by short fibre in American cotton.
            Before sowing removal of this necessary as it will make
            difficulty for sowing. It can be removed by chemical and
            Non-chemical method.
            <br />
            <br />
            In Non-chemical method, seeds are soaked in water overnight,
            then next day rubbed with cowdung and wood ash or saw dust
            then dried in shed before sowing.
            <br />
            In chemical method, Depending upon the fibres on the seeds,
            mix the 400 gm concentrated Sulphuric acid (Industrial grade)
            in per 4 kg seeds for American cotton and 300 gm for 3 kg Desi
            cotton seed for 2-3 minutes. It will burn all the fibers of
            seeds. Then 10 Ltr of water in container, stir well and
            drained out the water. Wash the seeds for three times with
            normal water and then lime water (Sodium
            Bicarbonate@50gm/10Ltr of water) for 1 min. Give one more
            washing then dry the seeds in shed. <br />
            Do not use Metal or wood container instead use plastic or

            Due to wide spaced crop weeds pose serious threat. A weed free
            period of 50-60 days from sowing is necessary for good yield
            otherwise it may cause 60-80% reduction in yields. Manual,
            mechanical and chemical methods of weed control in combination
            is necessary for effective weed control. Carry out first manual
            hoeing 5-6 weeks after sowing or before first irrigation.
            Remaining hoeing should be done after each irrigation. Do not
            allow congress grass to grow around cotton fields, as they
            increase the possibility of mealy bug infestation.
            <p></p>
            To control weeds after sowing but before its emergence take
            spray of Pendimethalin @ 25-33 ml/10 Ltr of water. Apply
            Paraquat (Gramoxone) 24% WSC @ 500 ml/acre or Glyphosate @1
